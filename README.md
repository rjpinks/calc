# <Next Calculator>

## Description

This is a calculator app that follows order of operatoins and can take negative numbers. I created this app as a refresher on CSS and JSX since I've only been doing leetcode, but I also used the Next.js framework for the first time. I relearned a lot about state.


## Installation

You'll need to install the bootstrap package.

## Usage

Simply click on the buttons to do math. It will iterate through and perform multiplication and division before doing addition and subtraction. It also accepts negative numbers. Once you have entered in the expression, press enter. Be careful! if you begin or end with an operator (+,-,*, or /) then it'll display "ERROR".

## Credits

This app used Next.js and the Bootstrap frameworks.

## Ways to Expand

- Include parenthesis in the operations.
- Include exponents and square root.
- Add additional CSS effects.
